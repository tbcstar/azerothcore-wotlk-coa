-- Worldforged pickups: Silverpine Forest, the objects the realm's own records restore
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The zone pass beside this file judges the zone marker by marker.  Three of its markers
-- name an object this world does not carry, and the realm's own records decide what each
-- one is:
--
--   * The Law of Light (111004) - the archive's own client-cache record, at the very spot:
--     the realm's own sighting of that entry in Silverpine stands 1.7 yd from the marker.
--     It is a second object of that name (display 184795, a book, where the entry this
--     world already carries - 111000, display 184790 - is the one the map plots in Loch
--     Modan, Darkshore and Westfall).  The marker names item 9200812, which this world has;
--     the same-named object's Loch Modan placing already hands it out, and this module's
--     shape is one pickup one item, so the row is written here too and the book is not empty.
--
--   * Maddening Aura (101913) - the archive's own client-cache record, on the realm's own
--     sighting 1.7 yd from the marker, in Pyrewood Village: display 515662 (the shadow-leech
--     orb the realm uses for it), cast bar 'Inspecting', size 1.  No item named Maddening Aura
--     exists in any source in hand, so no loot row is written, as everywhere else.  The same
--     object is plotted on the Redridge Mountains page as well and the realm saw it there too
--     (-9407.3 -3090.8, entry 101913, 1.2 yd from that marker); that page's own pass left it
--     among the markers whose object could not be tied to an item, and it is restored here
--     for the Silverpine listing the realm's own record stands on.  The Redridge listing is
--     left as that pass left it.
--
--   * Arcane Crystal - left alone, and the reason is the marker's own description: "Item that
--     gives Arcane Cascade mystic enchant."  That is Mystic Scroll: Arcane Cascade (item
--     201595), and the Mystic Scroll family is deliberately outside this module's scope, as
--     the Redridge, Wetlands, Arathi, Hillsbrad and Hinterlands sections say.  The realm's own
--     records agree with the description rather than contradict it: the two entries of that
--     name it holds (99503 and 680016) both draw display 980926, the invisible placeholder,
--     so what stood in the world was the scroll's own sparkle, not a world object.  This is
--     also why the eighth and ninth passes (Westfall, Duskwood) left that marker alone.
--
-- Nothing is guessed: every field of both restored rows is the value the realm's own capture
-- states, and the height is the one the realm's own client saw each object at.
--
-- Idempotent: every statement is a REPLACE on an entry or a guid.  Apply to acore_world.
