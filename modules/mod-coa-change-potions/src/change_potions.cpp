 * mod-coa-change-potions - the six change potions and the three customization potions, in one
 * place: what they are, where they come from, and what drinking one does.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The items (data/sql/updates/pending_db_world/rev_20260927_10_coa_change_potion_items.sql)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nine item_template rows exist in the realm's own database and in the client's item cache
 * (Ascension_LocalLoot lists all nine), but none of them had a row anywhere in this repository:
 * three of them are dangling rows in mod-ethereal-bazaar's generated convenience list (Tiraxis,
 * 150 Bazaar Tokens each), and the other six have no source in tree at all.
 *
 *   200000  Customization Potion                customization (tradable)
 *   910201  Customization Potion                customization (Tiraxis)
 *   2001185 Soulbound Customization Potion      customization (account-bound)
 *   200001  Race Change Potion                  race (Tiraxis)
 *   2001181 Soulbound Race Change Potion        race (account-bound)
 *   910200  Faction Change Potion               faction (Tiraxis)
 *   505005  Faction Change Potion to Horde      faction, Alliance-only item, 7-day
 *   505006  Faction Change Potion to Alliance   faction, Horde-only item, 7-day
 *   97858   Class Change Potion                 class
 *
 * The first eight carry spell 200164 and the class potion carries 93216.  Both spells are the
 * client's own "Potion Visual": instant, description "Drink up!", a single effect of type 77
 * (SPELL_EFFECT_SCRIPT_EFFECT), and no spell_script_names row on the realm or in this tree.  In
 * other words the spell is a drink animation and nothing else; the service has always lived
 * server side, keyed on the item the player used, which is what this module supplies.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Race, faction and customization: the realm's own contract
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The 3.3.5a client applies these three services from the character selection screen, and the
 * whole contract is visible in this tree:
 *
 *   - Player::BuildEnumData writes SMSG_CHAR_ENUM's "character customize flags" word straight
 *     from the at-login flags (src/server/game/Entities/Player/Player.cpp:1283-1294):
 *     AT_LOGIN_CUSTOMIZE -> CHAR_CUSTOMIZE_FLAG_CUSTOMIZE, AT_LOGIN_CHANGE_FACTION ->
 *     CHAR_CUSTOMIZE_FLAG_FACTION, AT_LOGIN_CHANGE_RACE -> CHAR_CUSTOMIZE_FLAG_RACE.
 *   - The client's GlueXML turns those into the three service buttons (CharacterSelect.xml
 *     ServiceButtons: CustomizeButton / RaceChangeButton / FactionChangeButton; PAID_RACE_CHANGE
 *     = 3, PAID_FACTION_CHANGE = 2, PAID_CHARACTER_CUSTOMIZATION = 1).
 *   - Clicking one sends the stock opcodes CMSG_CHAR_RACE_CHANGE (0x4F8), CMSG_CHAR_FACTION_CHANGE
 *     (0x4D9) or CMSG_CHAR_CUSTOMIZE (0x473), which WorldSession::HandleCharFactionOrRaceChange /
 *     HandleCharCustomize accept only when the matching flag is set, and clear when the change is
 *     ordered (CharacterHandler.cpp:2098-2103, 2185, 1780-1786).
 *
 * So the missing half has always been just the flag.  Using one of the eight potions sets it - and
 * refuses to spend the potion when another service is already waiting, because the client can only
 * show one of the three buttons at a time.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Drinking a potion ends at the character screen, ten seconds later
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every potion now logs the character out to the character selection screen ten seconds after it
 * is used - ten seconds counted by WorldScript::OnUpdate, then WorldSession::LogoutPlayer, the same
 * call the core's own instant logout makes (HandleLogoutRequestOpcode), which is what sends
 * SMSG_LOGOUT_COMPLETE - 0x004E in the client's own opcode table, where CMSG_LOGOUT_REQUEST is
 * 0x004C and SMSG_LOGOUT_RESPONSE is 0x004D.  Both halves have to run on the world thread:
 * ScheduleLogout below
 * records why, with the crash a map-thread logout produced.  The service potions have nothing left
 * to do in the world once the flag is set, and the class potion cannot rebuild a client-side spell
 * book or action bar in place, so the screen the next step happens on is where the player is sent.
 * One notification says so, at most once, in the realm's own notice yellow; the chat copy of the
 * same sentence carries the potion as a real clickable item link.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Class: there is no contract to restore, so one had to be chosen
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing in the client or in the core can change a class.  The client's paid services are exactly
 * three (above); the client's opcode table lists no class-change opcode and no class button, and
 * the core has no class-change path at all.  The live realm's class change therefore
 * ran on Ascension's own core, and its "which class" step never reached anything we have - which
 * is why this module supplies one: the potion opens an item gossip menu listing the realm's own
 * classes (12..32, the 21 Ascension classes, filtered by sObjectMgr->GetPlayerInfo(race, class),
 * which this repository already treats as the authoritative availability list -
 * rev_20260920_00_custom_class_starting_action_bars.sql says so in as many words), and the pick
 * rebuilds the character.
 *
 * The rebuild is not a class id swap with grants on top of it.  It reproduces, as closely as a
 * server can, the character that would exist if this one had been created at level one as the class
 * being chosen and leveled normally to the level it is.  Spells and their ranks, talents,
 * proficiencies, skill lines and the equipment the class can actually use are derived from that one
 * question, from the realm's own definitions of a class (the long comment above ClassKit lists
 * them, and BuildKit is where they are read); the character's own non-class progression - level,
 * experience, professions, quest and item rewards, mounts, identity - is carried over untouched.
 * Every class-owned spell of the class being left that the class being entered does not account for
 * is removed rather than merely not re-granted, and the removal is bounded by the union of every
 * class's definitions rather than by the class being left, so A -> B -> C -> A ends where A -> A
 * would have.  The section above ClassKit is the full statement of the rule.
 *
 * The player is told what happened and is logged out ten seconds later, because a rebuilt class is
 * a relog: the client's spellbook, talent tree and action bar cannot be rebuilt in place.  Action
 * bars are replaced rather than left to break.  The realm's own progression service
 * (AscensionCompat's AscensionClassService::OnPlayerLogin -> SynchronizeProgression) then reconciles
 * and completes the state on the way back in, for the class the character is by then.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why an ItemScript and not an AllItemScript
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The class menu needs the item's gossip handler, and the core reaches item gossip through the
 * item's script id (WorldSession::HandleGossipSelectOptionOpcode's guid.IsItem() branch ->
 * ScriptMgr::OnGossipSelect(player, item, ...) -> ScriptRegistry<ItemScript>), which is keyed on
 * item_template.ScriptName - so the nine rows carry ScriptName = 'item_coa_change_potion' and this
 * single ItemScript answers all nine entries by entry, exactly like
 * src/server/coa/AscensionBankVoucher.cpp does for the bank voucher.
 *
 * One rule from that shape is worth knowing before editing this file: answering OnUse with `true`
 * keeps the core out of the cast entirely, so the potion is spent here - and the item object does
 * not outlive Player::DestroyItemCount.  Everything the handler still needs is read first.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A class, as this realm defines one
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The module never asks what could be added to an existing character to make it resemble another
// class.  It asks the one question the realm can answer: what does a character of that class hold
// when it is created at level one and leveled to the level this character is?  Five of the realm's
// own definitions answer it, and they are the same ones its creation and level-up paths read:
//
//   AscensionLiveBaseline::Spells / ::Proficiencies / ::Skills
//       the level-one character: the CoA library's InitializeLiveBaseline builds exactly these
//       inside Player::Create (generated from the live realm);
//   playercreateinfo_spell_custom / playercreateinfo_skills
//       learned at creation through the core's own LearnCustomSpells / LearnDefaultSkills
//       (PlayerStart.CustomSpells is on in this realm);
//   AscensionCompatData::ClassSpells and `ascension_custom_class_spell`
//       the level ladder - the class's abilities with the level each arrives at, which
//       AscensionCompat's OnPlayerLevelChanged hands out while leveling;
//   AscensionProgression::Ranks
//       the rank upgrades, each with the level the realm teaches it at, handed out once the spell
//       they upgrade is held;
//   AscensionCompatData::CoATalentEntries with CoAAutomaticDependencies
//       the free, automatic class-tree talents: no cost, a level gate, a prerequisite gate.
//
// One more pair bounds the class without being granted: UnresolvedTrainerSpells (a character of the
// class may hold these - a trainer sells them - and a potion never hands them out, which is the
// user's rule that a potion grants only what leveling itself grants) and AscensionCompatData's
// ProficiencyDefinitions, the weapon and armour catalogue, which carries its skill lines with it and
// is reconciled on its own (TakeProficiencies).
//
// Removal is bounded the other way, and that is what keeps a class change from becoming a change by
// addition: a spell is taken away only when one of the realm's class definitions owns it, and the
// catalogue is built once over EVERY class rather than over the class being left.  A profession, a
// quest reward, a mount, an item-granted spell or a racial ability belongs to no class and is never
// touched; a spell the old class owns and the new one does not is removed whichever class brought
// it, so a second or third change cannot accumulate what an earlier one handed out.
//
// What the change hands out is the class's base state, never its progression.  It is the same
// distinction the whole module turns on: a potion establishes what a character of a class is, and
// leaves what that character learns afterwards to the player.
//
// Talents follow the spellbook, because that is where this realm keeps them (AscensionCoATalentState
// derives the whole Character Advancement state from known spells): the old class's talent spells
// leave with the rest of its spells, the chosen specialization and every stored build are cleared (a
// character created as the new class has chosen none), and the new class's class tree is offered
// with nothing spent in it.  Its free automatic nodes are the realm's own progressor's business
// (AscensionCompat hands them out on login to whoever holds their prerequisites), and every other
// node, like every rank upgrade and every trainer offer, is a choice the player makes afterwards -
// so a class change grants none of them.  That is why Granted is read from the class as creation
// builds it (level one) while Allowed is read at the character's own level: the first is what the
// change gives, the second is what it is allowed to leave in place.
