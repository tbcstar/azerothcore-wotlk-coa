-- Reaper "Reliquary of the Lost" (500631) consumed Reaped Souls and did nothing: its periodic helper chain only
-- reaches cosmetic auras, and the Soul Bolt damage spell (500627) was never cast by anything. The script now
-- launches three Soul Bolts over five seconds along a line in front of the caster.
-- The tooltip gives Soul Bolt only an attack-power term (0.4), so its spell-power coefficient is zeroed.
