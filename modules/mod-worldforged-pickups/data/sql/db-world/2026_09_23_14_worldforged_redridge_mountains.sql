-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Worldforged pickups: Redridge Mountains, judged against the realm map marker by marker
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Each marker is given the object it means (the object of that name, the object whose loot
-- row carries that name as its item, or the object the archive's loot pin at that spot
-- names). A pickup of that object within 3 yd means the marker stands; farther out the
-- nearest pickup is moved onto the marker, unless it already honours a marker of its own
-- object 6 yd or more away, in which case the realm had a second placing and one is added.
-- Where the realm's own record for an object agrees with the pickup but not with this
-- marker, the two are one placement the map recorded twice and nothing moves.  A pickup
-- standing hundreds of yards from its marker is only moved when the realm's own records
-- put that object here; a name the map plots on two pages is never carried across.
--
-- Idempotent.  Apply to acore_world.
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

--
-- Nothing in this zone was out of place: all thirty-one of the page's markers that this
-- world has an object for stand 0.0-2 yd on it, and no pickup of the zone stands on no
-- marker of any page, so no row is moved and none is dropped.  The page's other eight
-- markers are objects the realm had and this world does not carry.  Every one of them is
-- in the realm's own client-cache dump and in the archive's world-object index:
--
--   * five are named by a Conquest of Azeroth loot pin within four yards as Mystic Scroll
--     chests, and are left alone with the rest of that family:
--
--       Codex of Divine Mending (99018, display 184777)   Mystic Scroll: Promise of Renewal  1.9 yd, 3 records
--       Drowned Adventurer (101911, display 980926)       Mystic Scroll: Divine Reprieve     3.1 yd, 1 record
--       Cultivated Blazethorn (735923, display 1010579)   Mystic Scroll: Sudden Aftermath    3.1 yd, 4 records
--       Pilfered Shield (90210, display 1011608)          Mystic Scroll: Revengeful Block    3.7 yd, 3 records
--       Redfang's Cache (835953, display 336)             Mystic Scroll: Stalker's Mark      3.5 yd, 1 record
--
--   * three have no item record in any source inside sixty yards, so nothing is invented
--     for them.  Each is a chest the realm's own dump sees standing on its marker:
--     Flourishing Flowers (1190585, display 1060657) 0.5 yd, Shadowbound Doll (95024,
--     display 1046185) 0.6 yd and Maddening Aura (101913, display 515662) 1.2 yd - the
--     nearest pin to either of the last two, 37 and 43 yd away, belongs to the treasure
--     those yards away and not to them.
--
-- Redfang's Cache is the one the realm's own records can restore, and is restored here.
-- The map plots the marker at -9793.4 -2219.1; the realm's own dump sees its chest
-- (entry 835953) 0.5 yd from that spot, and a Conquest of Azeroth loot pin five and a half
-- yards from it names Melika's Ring (item 500813).  The object is written as the realm's
-- own client cache holds it - its entry, its name, its display 336, its cast bar, the
-- chest lock 1689 and its own loot-table id - and the loot row hands out that one item,
-- which is the shape this module uses: one pickup, one item.  The chest's own loot table
-- is a server-side table this world has never carried, so it cannot be read; the realm's
-- loot pin is what ties the item to the spot.  Its other pin, a Mystic Scroll, is out of
-- scope with the rest of that family.
