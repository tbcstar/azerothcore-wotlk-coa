-- Tiraxis (900007) is the Ethereal Bazaar's scripted vendor again.
--
-- rev_20260918_20_books_of_ascension.sql rebuilt his template from entry 2672, which carries no
-- ScriptName, and gave him gossip menu 90007 with a single "browse your goods" option. That
-- replaced npc_tiraxis (mod-ethereal-bazaar), so the Bazaar, Convenience Items, Lost Caches,
-- Stones of Retreat and Heirlooms lists were gone. The script builds its own menu, so the
-- template gets the script back and no gossip menu.
