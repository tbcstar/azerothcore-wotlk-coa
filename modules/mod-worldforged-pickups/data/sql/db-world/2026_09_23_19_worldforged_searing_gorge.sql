-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Worldforged pickups: Searing Gorge, judged against the realm map marker by marker
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Each marker is given the object it means (the object of that name, the object whose loot
-- row carries that name as its item, or the object the archive's loot pin at that spot
-- names). A pickup of that object within 3 yd means the marker stands; farther out the
-- nearest pickup is moved onto the marker, unless it already honours a marker of its own
-- object 6 yd or more away, in which case the realm had a second placing and one is added.
-- Where the realm's own record for an object agrees with the pickup but not with this
-- marker, the two are one placement the map recorded twice and nothing moves.  A pickup
-- standing hundreds of yards from its marker is only moved when the realm's own records
-- put that object here; a name the map plots on two pages is never carried across.
--
-- Idempotent.  Apply to acore_world.
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What this pass found:
--
--   * four chests the zone's map lists twice - once by the item the pickup hands out, once by
--     the object it is.  Incendiosaur Bone String, Dark Iron Legplates and Dark Iron Wristbands
--     are the item's listing on this zone's page, with Pile of Bones, Dwarf Corpse and Broken
--     Chain the object's listing on the Dun Morogh page, three to five yards away; Taskmaster's
--     Blade is the object's listing on this page, and the item it hands out, Searsteel Claymore,
--     is the Blackrock Mountain page's, 4.1 yd away.  In all four the realm's own record for
--     the object agrees with the object's listing (0.3 to 1.5 yd) and stands 3.9 to 4.5 yd from
--     the item's, so the pickup stands on the object's listing and the item's is the map's
--     redrawing of it - the reading the Westfall pass took for its two such markers.  Three
--     pickups therefore move, having stood on an item's listing, and Dark Iron Wristbands'
--     already stands on the object's listing and does not move.
--   * four objects this world never carried are restored field for field - entry, type, display,
--     size and data - each on the spot the realm's own client saw it.  Two the pass reached
--     through the client-cache corpus it reads (Incendiary Ammo Cache 1344096, Ripped Diary
--     Page 90449); the other two that corpus does not carry at all, and their records come from
--     the realm's own archive for the entry instead (Mysterious Orb 90044, fetched for the
--     entry; Volatile Lava 518367, the capture kept for it).  Nothing is guessed: every field
--     is a value one of those records states.  Ripped Diary Page is the name of the item it
--     hands out and takes that loot row; the other three name no item in any source in hand,
--     so their loot ids stay the entries their own records name and no row is written for
--     them.
--   * Volatile Lava's own display is the realm's invisible placeholder (980926, the client's
--     invisible_cube): what stands there is a hidden interactive chest, as in the realm, and
--     nothing visible stands within twenty-five yards of it in the realm's own sightings (the
--     nearest is the Stone Anvil twenty-two yards off, which this world already carries), so no
--     visible prop is restored beside it.
--
-- Of the 59 placements the map plots inside the zone - 52 of them on the zone's own page, the
-- rest a neighbour's listing of a chest this page also lists, or a marker a neighbour's page
-- files here - 55 are honoured by a pickup of their object standing within three yards: 47
-- already did, three are moved, one is kept at the realm's own record, and four are the
-- restorations above.  The four that are not are the item's listings of the chests listed
-- twice, standing 3.4 to 4.7 yd off on the redrawing.  No pickup in the zone stands on no
-- marker of any page, so no row is dropped.  Two more markers of the zone's page, Blackbreach
-- Handaxe and Defias Special Bucket, project into the neighbouring areas their own positions
-- fall in (Blackrock Stronghold and Burning Steppes); the world's own pickups stand exactly on
-- the page's plots for them (6940122, 6940346) and those areas' passes kept them.
