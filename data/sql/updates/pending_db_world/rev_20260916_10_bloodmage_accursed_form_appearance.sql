-- #159: Accursed Form (562572) shapeshifts into SpellShapeshiftForm 57 "Cursed Form", which the client
-- ships with CreatureDisplayID 0, so Unit::GetModelForForm returns 0 and the caster keeps their own model.
-- The appearance is authored in the hidden companion 562722 ("Accursed Form", rank "SLS"): an infinite
-- SPELL_AURA_TRANSFORM to creature 55332 plus MECHANIC_POLYMORPH immunity, and nothing ever applied it.
-- Entry/display joins come from the copied client's Creature.dbc (f1/f19): entry 55332 -> display 7654.

-- Display 7654 and model 8088 are in the copied client but absent from the server DBC extract.
-- The native DBC SQL loader reads these overrides; no local binary DBC replacement is needed.

-- Ride the companion on the form aura (type 2 = SPELL_LINK_AURA) so the gargoyle model and the Polymorph
-- protection the tooltip promises apply with Accursed Form and drop with it. 562722 has no duration of its
-- own, so the linked removal is what ends it when the 30 second form expires. Form 57 carries no model, and
-- Unit::RestoreDisplayId now falls through such forms to the surviving transform aura, so the gargoyle also
-- holds when Accursed Form replaces a standing Eternal Curse (800157) shapeshift.
-- 562722 also carries a third, untooltipped effect: SPELL_AURA_ADD_FLAT_MODIFIER with SPELLMOD_RADIUS -3
-- (EffectBasePoints -4, EffectDieSides 1) on SpellFamilyName 26 / EffectSpellClassMask[0] 0x2000. In this
-- Spell.dbc exactly one spell matches that mask - 707434 "Blood Orb" rank "Spawn", SPELL_EFFECT_SUMMON with
-- EffectRadiusIndex 193 (6 yd) - so its summon radius becomes 3 yd while Accursed Form is up. That is
-- authored Ascension data riding along with the transform, recorded here because linking 562722 is what
-- makes it reachable for the first time.
