-- Book of Artisans: the profession trainer book and its beginner edition.
--
-- Both creatures are recovered from the preservation archive's own record of the live realm
-- (creature cache, 254 and 184 client submissions, captured 2026-09-10), which carries the
-- fields the world database had lost:
--
--   57500  Book of Artisans            type 8 (critter), type_flags 1048576, rank 1,
--                                      display 48503, HealthModifier 1.0, movementId 999
--   57524  Beginner's Book of Artisans type 10, type_flags 134217728, rank 1,
--                                      display 48503, HealthModifier 1.31781, movementId 999
--
-- Display 48503 is Creature\FlyingBook\FlyingBook_01_Pet_purple.mdx (the client's own
-- CreatureDisplayInfo 48503 -> CreatureModelData 5633). The realm shipped 57500 pointing at
-- display 15901, which is Creature\ReinDeer\ReinDeer.mdx at 0.2 scale, and had no 57524 at all,
-- so there was no usable profession book anywhere in the world.
--
-- Trainers: `trainer` 200001 sits on the full book and 200002 on the beginner's copy, which
-- carries one row per profession: the rank that learns the trade, and
-- nothing above it. A beginner's book teaches the first step; the ladder is the full book's.
--
-- The page and the shop (section 5): both books answer a right click with the original's own
-- two options - "I require training!" and "I would like to browse your goods." - and the
-- shelves behind the second are Edna Mullby's counter, entry 1286, cloned row for row, so the
-- book sells the same items at the same prices she does.
--
-- The list is the professions, and only the professions (section 4b): the rows that learn a trade
-- and raise its ceiling. The realm's 200001 was carrying every recipe the game has - 4739 rows -
-- so a player reading the book was looking at a profession's whole catalogue, including the
-- patterns that in 3.3.5 were the reward for finding them somewhere in the world. The book is the
-- one place a profession is learned; a recipe stays where it is taught, sold, dropped, quested
-- for or discovered.
--
-- Spawns: only the Beginner's Book is a world prop - the tutorial sends players to it, "the
-- Beginner's Book of Artisans outside the inn". The full Book of Artisans is a summonable
-- companion instead (items 134987 and 750750 teach spell 750750, SPELL_EFFECT_SUMMON for
-- creature 57500), so it is removed from the map. The archive keeps one example position per
-- creature and no complete spawn list, so that is what the Beginner's Book is placed at: the
-- Barrens example. The orientation is not recorded either; the book faces Ratchet's innkeeper,
-- the nearest one.
--
-- Every statement is idempotent: the file is applied again whenever it changes.

--    realm's other clickable props carry so the book can actually be opened
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 57500 is the realm's own creature and the row this module adjusts; a database that has the
-- model but not the row - a rebuilt world, a fresh schema - would otherwise get two books whose
-- section 2 clone has nothing to copy from. Inserted only when it is missing, so the realm's own
-- fields are never overwritten; everything this module depends on is in the UPDATE below.

-- 4b. The list: the professions, and only the professions
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A trainer list is what its trainer teaches, and for a profession book that is the profession
-- itself: the rows that learn a trade and raise its ceiling. The recipes are not the book's
-- business - a pattern belongs to the trainer in the capital that teaches it, to the vendor that
-- sells it, or to the drop, the quest or the discovery it was earned from, and a book that lists
-- them is a book nobody can read: the realm's 200001 was holding 4739 rows, of which the
-- profession rows are 93.
--
-- The 93 rows below are the list itself rather than a filter over whatever a database happens to
-- hold: every spell of the client's own `Spell.dbc` whose effect 1, 2 or 3 is
--
--   44  SPELL_EFFECT_SKILL_STEP     the "Apprentice ... Grand Master <profession>" rows, which
--                                   learn the profession and raise its ceiling
--   47  SPELL_EFFECT_TRADE_SKILL    the trade-skill learn spells
--   118 SPELL_EFFECT_SKILL          a bare skill grant (CoA's Bushcraft)
--
-- and which the book already held. Fourteen professions at six ranks each - Apprentice,
-- Journeyman, Expert, Artisan, Master and Grand Master - plus CoA's own: Woodcutting and
-- Woodworking down to Artisan, and Bushcraft as a single grant. Nothing else in `trainer_spell`
-- is a profession row, so nothing else survives.
--
-- The book is the only place that teaches some of them: Bushcraft's single grant, and every rank
-- of Woodcutting and Woodworking up to Artisan, sit on no other trainer in the realm, so dropping
-- them would leave those three trades unreachable.
--
-- SQL cannot ask the client what a spell does, which is why the set is written out: the effects
-- live in `Spell.dbc`, the rows live here, and the two are kept in step by hand when the client's
-- spells change.
