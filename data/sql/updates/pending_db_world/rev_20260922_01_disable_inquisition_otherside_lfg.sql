-- Vaults of Inquisition (map 936) and Road to De Other Side (map 937) come out of Dungeon Finder.
-- DISABLE_TYPE_LFG_MAP locks both out of LFGMgr::InitializeLockedDungeons for every difficulty tier,
-- which also drops them from CachedDungeonMapStore's random-group results; neither map has a non-LFG
-- entrance, so this is the whole removal, not just the random pool.
