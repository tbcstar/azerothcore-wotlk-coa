-- Conquest of Azeroth rebuilt Dolanaar. It moved the inn 60 yards south and turned it 74 degrees, moved
-- Tallonkai's druid tower 110 yards south-east, put a two-storey house and a sentinel tower where they
-- stood, laid a plaza with a fountain between them, added three small houses, a tent, two bridges and a
-- brook, re-sculpted the ground and cut a termite den under the village. The stock residents stayed
-- behind, floating over the new ground or standing inside the new buildings. This moves them, and adds
-- the village's two CoA quests, 1660074 Termites in Teldrassil and 1660075 Stay a While.
--
-- WHERE EACH VALUE COMES FROM
--   inn and tower  every stock row of the two buildings follows its rigid move, read from the same WMO
--     placed in the stock and CoA collision data: the inn turns +73.7397 degrees about (9809.8609,
--     956.5562) to (9821.9019, 898.0601), z -2.3341; the tower turns -58.6709 degrees about (9905.7222,
--     987.7818) to (9955.5738, 888.7574), z +2.7863. The residents land on the CoA floors at their stock
--     height over the floor.
--   quest givers and enders  the client's QuestSuperTrack turn-in points; Keldamyr, Tallonkai, Athridas
--     and Laurna stand 0.7-1.9 yd from their transform points, which confirms the transforms.
--   signpost  the CoA terrain moves the same signpost placement (ADT uid 283648) 38 yards north-west,
--     turns it 5.0306 degrees and scales it 1.0703125; its arms follow.
--   inn rest area  CoA AreaTrigger.dbc 715 (the rest area stayed at the stock inn).
--   groups, houses, wildlife, patrols  INFERRED: hand-chosen points on the CoA ground; each row says why.
--   1660074, 1660075  the realm client cache (quests, creatures, displays, text 85162); Kaladir and the
--     queen stand at their SuperTrack points, Alenna at her Questie-X sighting; the termites are
--     hand-placed through the den on its navmesh. The sentinels at the barricades carry the stock
--     glaive and bow (equipment 1). Their aggro reach is 43 yards (detection range 18 + 25 levels), and
--     every termite and every other creature hostile to them keeps 46 yards away, less its wander, so they
--     hold the line without clearing the den or the forest around the crater.
--   appearance  STAND-IN displays for Kaladir and Alenna: their CoA displays are missing from the client.
--
-- Spawn guid block: creature 9007400-9007599. 62 stock rows moved, 31 termites, 5 critters, 3 barricade sentinels.
-- Each UPDATE matches guid and entry, so a row something else has changed is left alone.
