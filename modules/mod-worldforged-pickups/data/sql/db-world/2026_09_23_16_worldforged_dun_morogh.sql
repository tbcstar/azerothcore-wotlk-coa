-- Worldforged pickups: Dun Morogh and Coldridge Valley, judged against the realm map marker by marker
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Each marker is given the object it means (the object of that name, the object whose loot
-- row carries that name as its item, or the object the archive's loot pin at that spot
-- names). A pickup of that object within 3 yd means the marker stands; farther out the
-- nearest pickup is moved onto the marker, unless it already honours a marker of its own
-- object 6 yd or more away, in which case the realm had a second placing and one is added.
-- Where the realm's own record for an object agrees with the pickup but not with this
-- marker, the two are one placement the map recorded twice and nothing moves.  A pickup
-- standing hundreds of yards from its marker is only moved when the realm's own records
-- put that object here; a name the map plots on two pages is never carried across.

--
-- What this pass found, and how it differs from the passes before it:
--
--   * the map's own sub-zone pages (the Grizzled Den, Coldridge Pass, Chill Breeze Valley,
--     Gol'Bolar Quarry, Northshire Valley and thirty-five more) carry 380 markers of their
--     own, and the set the earlier passes read had no world rectangle for any of those
--     pages, so those markers were invisible to them.  Twenty-one of them stand in Dun
--     Morogh: the Grizzled Den's own chests, at the back of the zone by the Chill Breeze
--     Valley and the pass.  The complete set is used here, and every zone already written
--     is being re-read against it.
--   * nine placements the map lists twice (once on the zone page, once on a sub-zone or
--     neighbouring page a few yards away) are judged as one placement each: the realm's own
--     recording of the object decides which of the two plots is the real one.
--   * four pickups stood a few yards off their marker and are put on it; nothing in the
--     zone stands on no marker, so no row is dropped.
--   * three markers name objects this world never carried, and the realm's own dump holds
--     each of them standing within three yards of its marker.  They are restored field for
--     field from those records: Adlin's Cherry Pie (90639, the chest is the realm's own
--     invisible one, so the visible Cherry Pie prop 90635 the realm stood beside it is
--     restored with it), Brynja's Water Pouch (90640, display 1033132) and the Black Powder
--     Barrel (93002, display 30).  Each chest keeps its own lock and its own loot-table id;
--     the two whose item the map names are given the loot row for that item, and the barrel's
--     item is recorded in no source in hand and is left to the loot table its own record
--     names.
