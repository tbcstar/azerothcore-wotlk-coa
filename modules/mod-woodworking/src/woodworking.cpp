/* mod-woodworking - Woodcutting (skill 732) and Woodworking (skill 757).
 *
 * Three things in this profession cannot be expressed as data:
 *
 *   * the Lumber Axe (item 6954) handed to a character the moment they take
 *     either profession,
 *   * where a sawmill *is*, and
 *   * how a recipe is obtained at all, because neither trade has a trainer to
 *     obtain it from.
 *
 * The five Refine spells carry SpellFocusObject 1653 ("Sawmill" in
 * SpellFocusObject.dbc), and this core answers that field by searching the
 * caster's grid for a gameobject of that focus. The realm never had one at its
 * sawmill places: the client's own map addon publishes twenty spots
 * (Interface/FrameXML/Ascension_POI/StaticPOIs/GameObjectPOIs.lua, the
 * "Sawmill-*" pins, each with an exact position) and refining worked there with
 * nothing drawn. Two of those pins stand 2 and 11 yards from a lumber NPC - the
 * Westfall Woodworker and a Venture Co. Lumberjack - which is what the pins
 * mark: the realm's lumber camps.
 *
 * The core now asks scripts before it searches (Spell::CheckSpellFocus ->
 * ScriptMgr::OnSpellFocusAnswered), so this module answers the requirement for
 * the spells that carry focus 1653 - exactly the five Refine spells - and
 * leaves the field itself alone. That matters beyond bookkeeping: the server
 * sends that field with a refused cast, and it is what turns "Requires %s" into
 * "Requires Sawmill" on the player's screen.
 *
 * The answer is a place: within SAWMILL_SPOT_RANGE of any of the twenty
 * coordinates. Anywhere else the core's own search still runs, so a sawmill a
 * player has actually placed - the shop item's Portable Sawmill or the Tinker's
 * build, both owned by mod-portable-sawmill - answers the cast wherever it
 * stands. The marked places are the profession's home, not its only location.

// The twenty coordinates above are the client's own map pins - and the client's
// are not the truth. Its Elwynn Forest pin stands 145 yards short of the
// Eastvale Logging Camp, in empty ground, while the spot above is the camp.
//
// That is fixable from here, because the pins are not client data after all:
// the client's pin database is rebuilt from what the server sends. `DB_MapPOI`
// (Interface/FrameXML/Data/MapPOI.lua) is the store behind the world map, and
// the server feeds it over the JSON channel Extensions.dll opens on
// `SMSG_COA_AREA_POI_PAYLOAD` (0x77C, category `AREA_POI_PAYLOAD`). The handler
// that consumes one calls `CreatePOI`, which removes the pin already holding
// the incoming ID before it inserts - so a POI sent under one of the client's
// own keys, `Sawmill-Elwynn-Forest`, *replaces* that static pin, position and
// all. The client also keeps the payloads in a cache it replays on every
// `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD`, so one send per login covers the session.
//
// The name and description have to travel in the payload - it carries literals,
// not the client's globals - so they are the two strings the client itself
// would have used, `GlobalStrings.dbc` rows 15977 and 15978
// (`MINIMAP_TRACKING_SAWMILL` and `_DESC`).
//
// Only Elwynn Forest's pin is corrected. The pins the client ships for the
// other nineteen stand on their lumber camps (two of them within yards of a
// lumber NPC), and a pin that is already in the right place is not worth
// moving.

// Neither trade has a trainer. Woodcutting and Woodworking are CoA's own, no
// creature in the realm carries a row for either, and the Book of Artisans is
// the only thing that teaches them at all - so a recipe that exists only as a
// row that book sells is a recipe these two trades cannot really have.
//
// `Refine Forestwood Plank` is the exception the client makes itself: its
// `SkillLineAbility` row says learned on skill value, so it arrives with the
// trade. Every other recipe of both trades is marked trainer-taught, and there
// is no trainer to teach it - which is what a gathering character notices as
// "there is only the first kind of wood".
//
// This script is that trainer, without the shopping: a recipe is learned as the
// skill reaches it. The list is not written out here either - it is read from
// the client's `SkillLineAbility` at startup, so the client stays the only place
// a recipe is declared, and a client whose spells change moves this list and
// nothing else.
//
// The gate is the one the client declares for the recipe: its
// `MinSkillLineRank` where that is above 1, which is how the four Refine spells
// above Forestwood are gated (65, 125, 165 and 230), and its
// `TrivialSkillLineRankLow` otherwise, which is where the wood tiers sit -
// Forestwood from 10, Wildwood from 60, Everwood from 115, Grovewood from 165,
// Heartwood from 220.
//
// Only the trades' own recipes are taken. A row whose effect is one of the
// profession rows (44 SPELL_EFFECT_SKILL_STEP, 47 SPELL_EFFECT_TRADE_SKILL,
// 118 SPELL_EFFECT_SKILL) is the rank that learns the trade or raises its
// ceiling, not something the trade makes, and those stay where they are: on the
// book, bought by the character who wants the next step of the ladder.
