-- The Wondrous Wisdomball's greeting, and the menu it opens with.
--
-- The frame's text area is drawn from an npc_text row, and the ball had none: its window used to
-- open with the greeting empty and only the paging line under it. This restores the companion's
-- own greeting as Ascension wrote it, in both voices (the client picks by the character's
-- gender), with the paragraph breaks it used. The quest names beside it are not rows of anything
-- - the module builds them into the menu's quest half at run time, which is what makes the client
-- draw its own "!" and "?" markers and colour each title by level.
--
-- The gossip_menu row is the ball's own menu id, so a menu this small is also described in the
-- database: the script sends this text id itself, and this is the row it names.
