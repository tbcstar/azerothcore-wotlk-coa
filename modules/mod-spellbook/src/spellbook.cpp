/*
 * Spellbook: the Books of Ascension as a real class trainer.
 *
 * Right-clicking a book opens the ordinary trainer window - the one with known, available
 * and unavailable rows and a Train button - and the list is built for whoever opened it, so
 * a book someone else put down trains your class, not theirs.
 *
 * Two things here are deliberate:
 *
 *  * The list is sent by hand instead of through Trainer::SendSpells. The core's version
 *    filters every row through Player::IsSpellFitByClassAndRace, which asks
 *    SkillRaceClassInfo.dbc about the spell's skill line, and that table has no rows for
 *    Ascension's classes (ids 12 and up). Every custom spell is therefore filtered out and
 *    the window arrives empty, which is indistinguishable client side from a book that does
 *    nothing.
 *
 *  * Purchases are answered here too. The core resolves trainers per creature entry
 *    (sObjectMgr->GetTrainer(npc->GetEntry())), which cannot serve a list that depends on who
 *    is looking, and Trainer::TeachSpell runs the same class/race filter that would refuse
 *    every one of these spells. Because the row set is the server's, a purchase re-publishes
 *    it: the rank just bought turns "used" and the rank above it turns trainable, in the same
 *    window. The re-sent window carries the same rows in the same order as the one on screen -
 *    a held rank stays in the list rather than leaving it - so the client's own restore of its
 *    selection and scroll position lands on the row the player was on and nothing moves.
 *
 *    A purchase is also announced exactly once, by the core: an ability the character did not
 *    have arrives as SMSG_LEARNED_SPELL, and a rank up as SMSG_SUPERCEDED_SPELL, which the
 *    client announces itself. The window sends no learned-spell packet of its own, or a rank
 *    up would show its line twice.
 *
 * The list itself is what automatic progression would have granted: class progression spells,
 * rank upgrades gated on their first rank, and the automatic talent entries. No ability is
 * invented here, so the book can never offer something the realm would not have given.
