# AGENTS.md

AzerothCore is a C++ MMORPG server emulator for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a (WotLK), built with CMake, backed by MySQL.

## Agent rules

- Configure and build when needed to implement the requested work; prefer focused incremental targets.
- **Never edit SQL files outside `data/sql/updates/pending_db_*/` unless explicitly requested.** `data/sql/base/`, `data/sql/archive/`, and `data/sql/updates/db_*/` are immutable.
- Formatting follows `.editorconfig`: UTF-8, LF, max 120 cols, trailing newline, no trailing whitespace; 4-space indent for C++ (tabs forbidden), 2-space for JSON/YAML/sh/ts/js.
- Keep ordinary plans and results in the conversation. If a planning document is requested or necessary,
  use `.agents/plans/<task-slug>/` (gitignored); no per-task document is required.
- Use existing tools. Routine edits need no source snapshots, backup folders, receipts, or standalone reports.
  Preserve unique untracked work and use Git diffs for tracked files.
- A source-only task ends with the requested change and its verification. Deployment and in-game acceptance
  are separate scopes. Repeat passing checks only after changes or a specific unresolved concern.
- In CoA-owned code, express intent through names, structure and tests; do not add explanatory comments or
  docstrings. Preserve legal notices, tool directives and test generator markers. Scope is
  `src/server/coa/`, `apps/coa-tests/`, `apps/coa-bugreport/`,
  `apps/coa-{dbc,gameplay-test,mechanics,world-content}/`, `tools/` and `.github/scripts/`.
  The `source` stage of `tools/verify_all.py` enforces this for C++ and Python; without `--base` it audits the
  full scope.
- In inherited AzerothCore source, keep existing comments so upstream merges stay clean; change a comment only
  with the code it describes. Add comments there only for non-obvious external constraints or rationale that
  the code cannot express. Preserve legal attribution and machine-consumed directives.

## Investigating reported defects

Follow this sequence within the task's authorized scope:
**Report → inspect effective data → establish expected behavior → reproduce → minimal fix → verification → PR.**

- Treat the report as evidence to investigate. For spells and quests, inspect effective DBC/SQL data, acquisition
  and the execution path using the inspector and mechanic map. Derive expectations independently of the current
  implementation and use a metric that can distinguish correct behavior from the reported failure.
- Before changing gameplay, classify the finding as **confirmed defect**, **already works**, **incorrect test**,
  or **uncertain expectation**. Correct a faulty test; preserve evidence of working behavior; keep unresolved
  expectations explicit. Apply a gameplay fix only to an established defect.
- Seek a focused reproduction and a regression that fails before the fix and passes after it, both run through
  `tools/verify_all.py`. State when runtime reproduction is unavailable (an `unavailable` gameplay stage);
  explain the missing prerequisites and complete the remaining stages. Report their actual scope.
- Review the final diff. Continue to a PR when publication is part of the requested workflow; a local edit alone
  does not authorize a push or PR. Use the issue-to-PR skill for an explicitly requested issue queue workflow.
- In existing task/PR results, summarize available time from investigation start to verified outcome, observed
  regressions, flaky checks (different outcomes with unchanged inputs), and required human corrections.
  Mark unavailable measurements as unknown; do not infer zero or create separate tracking files for routine work.

## Verification

- Verify changes only with `python -B tools/verify_all.py` ([guide](docs/coa/verification.md)). It runs the
  source checks, build, unit tests, Python test scripts, `apps/coa-tests` harnesses and gameplay scenarios. Do not
  run `check_source.py`, `ctest`, test scripts, harnesses, `run.py run` or `batch.py` yourself; where a guide
  names one, use the matching selection (`--stages harness --harness <name>`, `--stages source`).
- While iterating, pair `--stages` with a focus filter (`--scenario`/`--spell`/`--quest`/`--query`, `--harness`)
  and include `build` whenever sources changed. Before a PR, or when full verification is requested, run every
  stage with the PR base: `python -B tools/verify_all.py --base origin/main`.
- The `codestyle-cpp.py`/`codestyle-sql.py --files` linters are separate; still run them on changed C++ and SQL.
- Report the final `VERIFY ALL: PASSED|FAILED|INCOMPLETE` line with its `report.json`, the stages that ran,
  unavailable or blocked scope with reasons, and any `batch_sensitive` scenarios. Only `PASSED` is a pass, and
  only for what ran. A full run is not yet all green on any setup; classify each failure or unavailable item as a
  documented prerequisite, pre-existing on the base, acceleration-specific (a real-clock reference run passes it)
  or new ([full runs](docs/coa/verification.md#full-runs)). A new failure blocks a PR.
- Gameplay runs on a simulated clock by default: also report `acceleration_sensitive` ids, and confirm timing
  results with `--gameplay-clock real` ([accelerated mode](docs/coa/verification.md#accelerated-single-server-mode)).
- `run.py validate`, `catalog.py` and `workflow.py` remain authoring and discovery tools, not verification.

- Scoped source checks (boundaries, registrations, tooling regressions) →
  `python -B tools/verify_all.py --stages source --base <ref>`; `report.json` and `source.log` list the suites
  it selected (`--plan` shows only the command).
- SQL change boundaries → the `source` stage against `--base <ref>`; CI exceptions need a maintainer's
  `sql-change-authorized` PR label. A label does not replace the task's explicit SQL authorization.

## Repository layout

- `src/common/` — networking (Asio), crypto, config, logging, shared utilities.
- `src/server/game/` — core gameplay; compiled into worldserver.
- `src/server/scripts/` — content scripts grouped by region (`EasternKingdoms/`, `Northrend/`, …), class (`Spells/spell_mage.cpp`, …), and domain (`Commands/`, `Pet/`, `OutdoorPvP/`, `World/`).
- `src/server/database/` — DB abstraction and schema updater.
- `src/server/shared/` — code shared by auth and world servers.
- `src/server/apps/{authserver,worldserver}/` — entry points (ports 3724 and 8085).
- `src/test/` — unit tests + mocks.
- `data/sql/` — `base/` (historical schema), `updates/db_*/` (merged), `updates/pending_db_*/` (in-flight), `custom/` (gitignored).
- `modules/` — external modules (see below).
- `apps/` — helper scripts; `apps/codestyle/` holds the lint scripts.
- `conf/dist/` — distributed config templates; `conf/*.conf` is gitignored.
- `deps/` — vendored third-party dependencies.

## Modules

External modules live in `modules/`, each with its sources in `src/`. Disable one with
`-DMODULE_<DIRECTORY>=disabled`, the directory name in upper case with its hyphens (for example
`-DMODULE_MOD-SPELLBOOK=disabled`). See `modules/how_to_make_a_module.md`.

In this fork, CoA is a required server component in `src/server/coa/`, with focused tests in
`apps/coa-tests/`. `modules/mod-ascension/data/sql/` keeps its historical SQL migrations only.
`origin` is the CoA fork; `upstream` is the original AzerothCore
repository. Fetching upstream is separate from reviewing, merging, building or deploying its changes.

## Maintaining guidance

Keep only stable conventions and essential routing here. Update guidance when requested or when a durable
correction is needed; do not automatically offer lesson capture, install skills, or append task histories.
